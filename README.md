# My First Repo
## Here I will list my goals of using Git, and play around with the styling and formatting of markdown files.

**My main interests in relation to coding are:**
 - the ability to be creative in a logical way. I don't want to have to choose between mathematics and creativity. I believe there is a lot of math in art, and a lot of art in math. When I am drawing, my brain is constantly performing calculations unconsciously relating to space, geometrics - additionally, math makes a lot more sense to me when I stop thinking about it so rigidly and visualise it instead.
 - Following on from the first dot point, you can probably guess I'm interested in User Interface and Experience.
 - Javascript, html & css, Python, and some MIPS are the languages I currently have a decent understanding of. I am learning Java this coming semester at Uni.
 - I would like to delve more into understanding JSON, js.node, API's - all these additional things that aren't languages but can be used to allow greater development opportunities within my code.

**Through having a Git account, I want to:**
 - Track my progress. Particularly through a clear timeline where I can visualise my progress - through overviews as well as being able to document finer detail.
 - find inspiration and maintain good coding practice.
 - Keep up to date with new ideas and software development.
 - meet some cool, smart people :sunglasses:

I find for me, my understanding of code skyrockets when I have the resources to clearly organise and document it. Explaining what I have done and collaborating really consolidates information and gives me a broader understanding, as well as forcing me into thinking about things in ways I haven't before.
